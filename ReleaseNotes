Release Notes for FreeNAS 9.2.0-RC

* Version 9.2-RELEASE of FreeBSD with performance improvements, bug
fixes, and updated software packages.  For a complete list see
http://www.freebsd.org/releases/9.2R/relnotes.html

* USB 3.0 support is disabled by default as it currently is not compatible
with some hardware, including Haswell (Lynx point) chipsets. To enable
USB 3.0 support, create a Tunable named xhci_load, set its value to YES,
and reboot the system.

* The Kernel UMA allocator is now the default for ZFS.  This results in
higher ZFS performance.

* Avahi (multicast DNS, aka Bonjour) registration of all services, include
the web service, means you no longer need to have a head on the box to know
its IP address, even for initial configuration.  freenas.local is the default
(or freenas-n.local, where n is the # of freenas.local machines already on
the local network).  This can be changed by changing the hostname.

* The built-in admin user account is no longer used and the Admin Account
removed. The first time the FreeNAS graphical interface is accessed, a
pop-up menu will prompt for the root password. Subsequent logins to the
graphical interface will require this password.

* FreeNAS no longer sends daily emails when email reporting is enabled
unless actual errors or issues of concern have arisen. Simply saying
"all is well!" each and every day was causing email fatigue and obscuring
actual errors.  Those wishing for daily "all is well!" reports can simply
add a cron job that does this.

* The plugin system now offers in-place updates for plugins, also
segregating installed plugins from available plugins to make the UI
less cluttered.

* A complete REST API has been created for FreeNAS, allowing a FreeNAS
instance to be controlled remotely.  See examples/api in the FreeNAS
source repository (https://github.com/freenas/freenas/tree/master) for some
examples of this in action.  Complete API docs are available in docs/api.

* The "Permit Sudo" field has been added to the add and edit screens for
Users and Groups.  A column in View Groups and View Users now indicates
whether or not "Permit Sudo" has been set.

* HTTP and HTTPS access to the FreeNAS graphical interface are no longer
mutually exclusive. The fields "WebGUI HTTP Port" and "WebGUI HTTPS Port"
have been added to System  Settings -> General.

* An "Edit" button has been added to the "Hostname" field of System
Information to make the hostname easier to change.

* The results from the latest ZFS scrub now appear in Volume Status.

* Netatalk has been updated to version 3.1.0. See
http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/3.1/ReleaseNotes3.1.0.html for a list of
changes in this release.  There are also a number of changes made to AFP
sharing as a result:

	* The Add Apple (AFP) Share menu has been simplified and a
	  "Default umask" option has been added.

	* The "Server Name" field has also been removed from AFP; in
          Netatalk 3, this value is automatically derived from the system
          hostname.

	* "Enable home directories" and "Home directories" options added
           to AFP.

* The AIO options have been removed from CIFS.

* Fourteen TLS-related fields have been added to the Advanced Mode of FTP.

* An "IPv4 Address" column has been added to the View Jails screen.

* A shell button has been added to Jails, making it easy to access the
command line of the selected jail.

* A "Create directory" checkbox has been added to the Add Storage function of
a jail so that the user does not have to first access the jail's shell to make
sure that the directory already exists. A "Read-Only" checkbox has also been
added to this screen.

* A jails templating system has been added, allowing the quick deployment of
new jails from existing templates and the ability to create custom templates.
Linux jail support has also been added and installation templates are included
for Debian-7.1.0, Gentoo-20130820, Ubuntu-13.04, Centos-6.4, Fedora-19, and
Suse-12.3.

* A link to the online FreeBSD manual pages has been added to Help.

* Added bxe(4) driver for Broadcom NetXtreme II Ethernet 10Gb PCIe adapter.

* Added padlock(4) driver which provides cryptographic hardware acceleration
for VIA C3, C7 and Eden processors.

* Improved performance of encrypted ZFS volumes.

* The iSCSI options have been updated to ensure the GUI constraints match the
daemon constraints.  In particular the GUI limited the number of sessions and
the number of connections to a low value that may need to be increased if there
are large numbers of targets or clients or both.
