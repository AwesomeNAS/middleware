Release Notes for FreeNAS 9.2.1-RC2

* Samba (SMB/CIFS support) upgraded to version 4.1.3.  This adds support for
SMB3, the ability for FreeNAS to be a Windows Domain Controller, and advanced
features like server-side copy support in Windows 2012 and later, along with
multiple years worth of improvements over the version of Samba that shipped
in 9.2.0.  It also enables SMB protocol version 3.  Previous versions of
FreeNAS limited samba to SMB2 because of random crashes that would occur using
SMB3.

* Added the LSI 12G SAS driver as a module to the build.  This can be
enabled by adding a tunable for mpslsi3_load with a value of YES.  This
driver is still under development and not yet committed to FreeBSD. It
is provided for beta testing only. For production use please consider using
a 6G SAS adapter, such as the LSI 9207.

* Fixed a bug with netatalk that prevented share browsing from working
in the finder on OSX.  Also enabled options for fuller-fidelity AFP copies
with Mac OS ACLs (ACEs) now stored as ZFS ACLs.
Remove the non functional share password field from AFP shares.

* Switched from Avahi to mDNSResponder for Zeroconf network configuration,
improving the Mac share browsing experience.

* Added additional Web API functionality for manipulating ZFS snapshots.

* Added IPMI network configuration support for machines with that capability.

* Brought back the FreeNAS 8.x volume manager as a "Manual Setup" option.
This volume manager allows manual vdev building and offers no seatbelts.
Unless you know exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it, using
the standard volume manager is highly recommended by the development team!

* Made some changes to reporting graphs that segregates reports by type,
one type per tab.  Add graphs that show individual disk activity.

* Fixed a bug that prevented building an encrypted volume using multipath
devices.

* Update django (used by the WebUI) to 1.6 and dojo to 1.9.2

* Add the following ZFS features: enabled_txg hole_birth, extensible_dataset,
bookmarks

* Add trafshow to the image.  This utility gives a CLI view of connections
and usage to the FreeNAS box.

* Fix kernel module load for fuse.  This is needed for importing NTFS
volumes.

* Add the ability to use a keytab for AD joins.  This eliminates the need
to use the AD Administrator account to join FreeNAS to AD, closing a long
standing issue of needing the AD Admin password in the FreeNAS configuration
database.

* Updated the LSI 6 Gbps HBA driver (mps) to version 16.  Please update the
firmware of any mps HBAs to phase 16.
