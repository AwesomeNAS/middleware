Release Notes for FreeNAS 9.3-BETA

There are so many new features and enhancements in FreeNAS 9.3 that this
BETA release requires us to break them into categories.  In no particular
order, FreeNAS 9.3-BETA offers the following improvements:


** Booting: **

  FreeNAS now uses ZFS for the boot device, also supporting mirroring of boot
devices for greater reliabilty.  The features of ZFS are also utilized to
provide "boot environments" which allow the system to be rolled back (or even
forked) to different OS versions. A boot-time menu is provided for selecting
and booting from a specific boot environment and a new system->boot UI screen
allows the user to create, name, delete, and select boot environments.

  Both the installer and the system now use the grub2 boot loader to provide
boot menus and boot-time UI.


** Updating: **

  While the monolithic Manual update system is still offered, the FreeNAS
project has now broken its releases into cryptographically signed packges,
also offering a secure update server which can be regularly polled
(default: once per day) and updates downloaded from it automatically, after
which the user will receive an alert and be given the opportunity to apply 
the updates.

  Updates are also offered along multiple, parallel "trains" that the user
can elect to follow.  Older stable trains will offer minimal number of updates,
more current trains offer new features and a faster rate of change, and
completely experimental trains with new, untested features under development
can all be offered simultaneously.

  Any train can be selected at the user's discretion at any time, trains can
be jumped between and, combined with the ZFS boot environment roll-back
feature, the user can even experiment with booting between multiple trains.

** File sharing: **

  WebDAV file sharing is now supported.

  Samba upgraded to 4.1.12.

  NFSv4 support added, including kerberized NFS.

  Kernel iSCSI (CTL) replacing the old iSCSI code, with support for
  VMWare VAAI, MS ODX and Windows 2012 Clustering.


** Directory Services **

  AD / LDAP configurations are validated immediately after input.

  Kerberos Realms and Keytabs have joined the Direcory Services UI.

  Directory Services now based on SSSD (System Security Services Daemon).


** User Interface: **

  The much hated interface tabs are completely gone.

  Settings and Directory Services UIs completely revamped and streamlined.

  Many hitherto difficult to discover or navigate to features have been
moved into their own sub-categories, new icons also being added where
applicable.  The tree menu and the top-level icons have also been harmonized.

  New UI for CA and Certificate management.

  New setup Wizard can handle most common types of configuration at
installation time or, as desired, later in the setup process.

  All tunables have been merged - loader, sysctl and rc.conf variables can
be managed from the same UI.
